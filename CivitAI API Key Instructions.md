# Creating a CivitAI API Key

1. **Log in to CivitAI:**
    * Go to the CivitAI website (civitai.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Access Account Settings:**
    * Click on your profile icon in the top right corner of the website.
    * Select "Account settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. **Navigate to API Keys:**
    * Scroll down the "Account settings" page until you find the "API Keys" section.

4. **Create a New API Key:**
    * Click the "+ Add API key" button.
    * Give your API key a descriptive name (e.g., "My Python Script" or "Web App Key").
    * Click the "Save" button.

5. **View and Copy Your API Key:**
    * The newly created API key will be displayed on the page. 
    * **Important:** Copy this key immediately. You will only be able to view it once.

6. **Use Your API Key:**
    * Use the copied API key in your scripts or applications according to the CivitAI API documentation. 

**Security Considerations:**

* **Treat your API key like a password.** Do not share it with anyone.
* **Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised.**
* **Consider creating separate API keys for different applications or scripts.**

By following these steps, you can successfully create and use an API key for your CivitAI account.
